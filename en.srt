00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,666
Will ideas fill your stomach?

181
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,625
Can't believe we travelled so far
to see this wastrel. Let's go!

182
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,708
Wait.

183
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,375
What's your business idea?

184
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,291
I want to make people fly.

185
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,166
On a bullock cart?

186
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,740
[cow moos]

187
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,458
On aeroplanes.

188
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,625
Cheap airline tickets.
Low-cost Aviation...

189
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,666
Twenty four banks have rejected me so far.

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,666
He's just being modest,
his business will take off soon.

191
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,125
We were told he's an Air Force officer,
that's why we came here.

192
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,708
Rani has plenty of suitors-

193
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,458
Twenty boys have rejected me so far.

194
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,708
- There she goes.
- Hey!

195
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,625
I can cook, sew, sing...

196
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,160
[playful music playing]

197
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,500
But I won't do any of that.

198
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,833
I want to start my own bakery.

199
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,416
Feeling light, having
blurted out the truth?

200
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,166
Come, let's eat now.

201
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,708
- Hey Mandar!
- What?

202
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,500
So your friend's gonna fly people
on cheap planes? For real?

203
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,958
Cheap tickets, not cheap planes!

204
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,041
You can sit on an aeroplane too!

205
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,958
And how will you fund
this airline of yours?

206
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,666
Enough! Let your father
do the talking.

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,250
It's my life at stake, not his!

208
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,041
What's your problem?
Going on and on...

209
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,125
- Can't you let us talk?
- She's a smart girl!

210
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,791
Let them talk.

211
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,041
Twenty guys rejected you, right?

212
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,708
Twenty four banks rejected you.
Let's talk about that first.

213
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,500
Most people can't handle bold ideas.

214
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,250
Most guys can't handle
bold women either.

215
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,166
How to start an airline
in one, two, three...

216
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,041
Just three steps?

217
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,250
Sounds pretty simple.

218
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,200
Why haven't you done it yet?

219
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,500
Starting a bakery is even simpler.
Why haven't you done it?

220
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,041
I'm waiting for a
'No Objection' certificate.

221
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,125
Really?

222
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,458
That's why.

223
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,500
I know what a bank is.
What's that written underneath?

224
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,458
- Ven-ture...
- Venture Capitalists.

225
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,833
Banks only grant loans
against a collateral.

226
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,750
Venture capitalists invest money
in ideas where they see potential.

227
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,708
The idea is the collateral.

228
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,750
I should find a Venture Capitalist too.

229
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,939
[Vir laughs]

230
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,083
Whose pictures are those,
all over the place?

231
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,625
Is he one of those 'Venture' guys?

232
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
No.

233
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,333
Paresh Goswami.

234
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,959
A man from a small village...
who built India's biggest airline.

235
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,916
He's my hero.

236
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,041
He held on to his big dreams,
and flew with them.

237
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,625
Do poor folks who can
barely make ends meet

238
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,126
really need to fly on aeroplanes?

239
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,875
A century ago, the poor
didn't need electricity...

240
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,333
and fifty years ago,
we didn't need motor vehicles!

241
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,541
Why must the rich always decide
what poor folks need?

242
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,375
Can't we decide for ourselves?

243
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,625
Don't we want to progress?

244
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,291
You won't get it, dad.
It's business!

245
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,958
It's a yes from me.

246
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,291
For what?

247
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,541
For marriage.

248
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,958
- Wow, Vir!
- That was quick!

249
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,750
We met just two hours ago.

250
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,583
Are you crazy?

251
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,291
Sometimes, one just knows.

252
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,041
Whether it's ten
minutes or ten years,

253
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,583
my decision won't change.

254
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,500
So why waste time?

255
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,416
That's our Vir!

256
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,750
I want to waste some time.

257
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,041
If I'm investing my life on an idea...

258
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,666
I need to think.

259
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,666
- I'll decide by morning.
- There she goes again!

260
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,458
Hey Mandar...
That's our Rani for you!

261
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,666
Can I have some pickle?

262

[inspirational music playing]

263
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,416
Let's go.

264
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,666
Move!

265
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,550
[cow moos]

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,333
Your mother said you have
a nice house in the village...

267
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,666
With a bathroom,
electricity, and all.

268
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,666
Why did you lie then?

269
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,791
That's not my house.

270
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,708
My father built it.

271
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,000
He's the one who got electricity
to our village too.

272
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,041
He wrote letters to everyone-
from the village head to the Prime Minister.

273
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,458
That's how we finally
got power in the village.

274
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,291
But I did things differently.

275
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,208
Down with the Government!

276
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,875
Down with the Government!

277
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,208
Down with tyranny!

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,458

- Vir, Mandar got hit by a stone!
- Vir!

00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,250
- Don't worry, Mandar!.
- I can't see!

290
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,375
I can't see anything!

291
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,166
Lift him up.

292
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,513
I can't see anything! Vir!

293
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,333
What happened?

294
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,083
What do you think?

295
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,125
Your son started a riot again!

296
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,500
Not a riot. A protest.

297
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,875
This is hooliganism!
Protest is what Gandhi did!

298
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,833
So what Bhagat Singh did
wasn't protest?

299
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,458
Mandar's head was badly injured.
He nearly lost his sight!

300
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,208
I go around the whole village
advocating non-violence...

301
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,000
And my own son
is busy pelting stones!

302
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,488
Dad, wasn't it you who said

303
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,625
that our village won't progress
until we have train connectivity?

304
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,708
Tell me?

305
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,833
Hey!

306
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,750
Have you no brains at all?

307
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,000
Did we not educate you?

308
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,041
If you want to demand trains,
do it properly, write a petition--

309
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,958
Your hands have worn out
writing letters all your life!

310
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,167
Calm down, now!

311
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,916
Your temper goes out of control
when you're hungry.

312
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,916
Your father's petition
got us electricity.

313
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,416
Or we'd still be using candles- -

314
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,916
Yes, twenty years
after he wrote it!

315
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,750
Twenty years...
What an achievement!

316
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,875
Writing letters doesn't
make you a revolutionary!

317
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,833
Vir! Enough!

318
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,041
- Kaveri, let him speak!
- Yes Ma, let me speak.

319
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,500
We had to travel 100 kilometres
just to get Mandar's wound dressed!

320
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,875
We have no hospital, no trains...

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Go, write petitions...

322
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,250
And drown in the pool of
your self-righteousness!

323
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,458
If you want your rights,
you need to raise your voice.

324
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,041
You need to be ready
to risk your life!

325
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,500
There's a difference between
non-violence and cowardice.

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,541
And you, Dad - are a coward!

327
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,541
A defeated and jaded coward!

328
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,166
And you'll remain one
all your life!

Great!

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,291
Your 'non-violent' facade
finally gone!

333
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:35,375
Forgive me, my son.

Even after I die...

335
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,417
Don't lay your eyes
on my cowardly face.

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,541

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,250
You sure have a temper!

340
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,291
What happened then?

341
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,625
Then what?

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,250
I took the exam,

343
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,208
got admitted into the
Short Service Commission...

344
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,958
And then the Air Force.

"Have one box if you want,
but leave the rest for my son!"

351
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,833
The last time, all the boxes
were delivered empty!

352

Aunty, there's a letter from Vir.

00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,417
No, your logic is wrong.

534
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,416
Override the method of the derived class.

535
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,625
Ok.

536
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,666
I think we got this.

537
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:29,250
Yes. It's running!
Source code ready!

538
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,750
You should have been
an IIT professor, sir!

539
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,708
- Brilliant!
- Brilliant?

540
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,541
He's living off his father-in-law!

541
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,083
Left his well paying Air Force job,
to sit at home and give tuitions!

542
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,250
Brilliant, my foot!

543
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,875
It's ok.

Now, makeâ

Hey, Mr. Bill Gates...
Richard Branson is here to see you!

546
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:54,666
Hey Vir!

547
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,583
You'll never find an investor!

548
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,416
What, uncle?

549
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,500
Luring these boys with
the promise of a partnership...

550
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,458
You'll ruin their lives
along with yours!

551
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,458
I can't hear you, uncle!

552

Take it from me in writing...

554
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,041
Your airline will never take off!

555
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,333
Do you hear me?

556
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:13,083
Can't hear you.
We'll talk tomorrow!

- You're welcome.

Thank you.

00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,333
Ma'am, here's your boarding pass.

561
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,125
And I'm really sorry, but we allow only
one hand-baggage per passenger.

562
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,916
- Please check-in the rest of your bags.
- Check-in?

563
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,041
They contain pickles and snacks.
It'll all be ruined!

564
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,666
There's a long queue ma'am,
people are waiting.

565
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:46,666
They're for my sister,
she's pregnant.

566
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,208
- Excuse me, Sir...
- Excuse me! Are you listening?

567
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,791
Do you know what
pregnancy cravings are like?

568
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,166
Can you come to
counter number 4 please?

569
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,583
Have you ever been pregnant?

570
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,291
Hello. Excuse me!

571
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,916
Is your manager a lady?
Call her. She'll understand.

- Call her.
- [Vir] Madam!

I'll take it.
I don't have any luggage.

- Really?
- Yes, don't worry.

575
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,761
Okay, thank you so much.

576
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,041
Now that's a gentleman!

577
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,500
Now check him in quickly.

578
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,500
These are my boxes.

579
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,583
Sir, here's your boarding pass.

580
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,958
- Thank you and have a safe flight!
- Thank you.

581
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,708
- Thank you so much!
- No problem.

582
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,459
You won't run off with my
pickles and snacks, right?

583
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,583
I'll decide once I've tasted them!

584
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,541
- Do you live in Mumbai?
- Yes.

585
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,250
So what are you going to Delhi for?

586
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,390
- I have work there.
- I see. What work?

587
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,000
Are you a journalist?

588
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,916

- Your barrage of questions!

- Yes, ma'am.

00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,958
- So what takes you to Delhi?
- I have a meeting there.

593
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,416
With whom?

Good evening, sir.

00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,583
My brother Bhavarlal is waiting outside.

601
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,708
- Just call him in.
- Sure, sir.

602
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,541
Are you okay?
Should I cancel the flight?

603
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,666
Don't fuss. Just an anxiety attack.

604
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,583
Did you have your medicine?

605
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,416
Tell me something...
Do the staff use this washroom too?

606
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,791
That guy just did his business here...

607
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,583
I'll have it cleaned.

608
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,583
I'll have him fired.

Are you kidding me?

I'm going to offer him
a business partnership.

612
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,416
He won't even look at you.

613
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,167
Try getting within ten feet of him.

614
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:48,787
Wanna bet on it?

615
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:50,167

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,333
The announcement was for Business class.

Relax, there's still time for us

622
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,458
You spent 20,000 rupees...

623
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,541
Then why were you standing
in the economy queue?

624

Strange!

I've drained my bank account
for this one hour meeting.

Sorry for disturbing you, but I had
no other way of meeting you.

I'll come straight to the point, sir.

for our chairman.

- You want to start an airline?
- Yes sir.

00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:46,000
Will the common man try to make a living
or fly in the clouds?

00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,166
Both.

655
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,708
- Sir my--
- Sounds like a charity scheme.

656
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,916
Sir, I want to partner with you
and start a low-cost airline.

657
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,833
India's first low-cost airline, sir.

658
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,458
Every second man on earth thinks
he has the next big innovative idea.

659
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,250
But every innovative idea isn't practical.

660
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,416
Sir, I know your time is very precious.
I won't waste it.

661
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:15,875
So you're saying you have an idea
to make low-cost aviation profitable

662
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,167
that we haven't thought of yet?

663
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,208
With all due respect, yes sir.

664
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:23,458
Sir, customers currently buy tickets
only via travel agents...

665
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,541
who charge a hefty 14% commission.

666
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:29,625
Just like the middlemen between
farmers and consumers.

667
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,375
If we were to eliminate
the middlemen, it will be...

668
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,666
How will passengers book tickets then?

669
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,625
On the Internet, sir. Online booking.

670
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,291
So farmers will harvest internet now!

671
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,166
Sir, people can access the internet
at their local post office.

672
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,626
There are about 500 post-offices
in Maharashtra alone,

673
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:51,875
all with internet connectivity.

674
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,125
Reliance petrol pumps
also have internet access.

675
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:58,583
There are 1475 of them
across India, with Internet.

676
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,041
People can book their tickets there.

677
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:04,458
In a few years, everything from
booking to banking will happen online.

678
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,375
The Internet will be at
everyone's fingertips.

679
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:11,751

needed to book tickets?

for all international airlines...

684

a humble craftsman can fly
with a clothing tycoon.

00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,208
- If I want to make it happen...
- Yes.

686
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,959
But I don't want that.

They don't want to fly with

690

after paying all that money!

691
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:51,500
Some birds can't fly,
even with wings.

692
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:58,500
And some men can walk,
even without a spine.

Why the heck should I
go to Economy class?

I've paid your chairman
for Business class.

699
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,958
I have the ticket.

- Sir, please-
- Get your hands off me!

or I'll break your teeth!

00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,666
<i>We apologise for the inconvenience caused.</i>

707
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,208
<i>Our crew will guide you from here on.
Thank you.</i>

708
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:49,083
The ticket may be yours,
but the plane is mine.

709
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:52,075
[intense music playing]

710
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:59,375
This way.

711
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:00,958
I know my way around!

712
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,416
- Your pickles and snacks.
- Thank you so much.

713
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:07,875
Mr. Mhatre...

714
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,333
Take care!

715
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:11,500
Come, drop me outside.

716
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,333
Mr. Mhatre!

717
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:15,791
I am Prakash Babu.

718
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,500
Venture Capitalist, Fundflow Ventures.

719
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,333
I know.

720
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,666
I've made many rounds of your office.

721
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,875
It's impossible to get even
five minutes of your time.

722
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:26,323
[Prakash laughing]

723
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,041
Well, thanks to your stunt,
I have an hour to spare now.

724
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,875
Want to chat?

725
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:36,542
[people chattering]

726
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,458
Sir, your dosa.

727
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,125
Thank you.

728
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:49,000
Vir, if you want to
get money out of me,

729
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,333
at least buy me lunch
at the 5-star hotel next door!

730
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,750
I'm sorry you couldn't
eat on the flight because of me...

731
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:58,125
But please, I insist...
Just try this food once, sir.

732
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:07,500
- It's excellent, actually.
- Excellent?

733
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,292
Brother!
Sir says the food's excellent.

734
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,791
People come all the way
from Chennai to eat here.

735
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,500
Tell him your secret ingredient?

736
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,083
There's no secret.

737
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:24,334
We get all our cooking supplies
from the Chintamani store nearby.

738
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:25,916
And guess what?

739
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,208
The 5-star hotel over there
also buys their supplies from there!

740
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,958
And Vir Bhai, don't tell anyone...

741
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:36,375
But their chef comes here
every night for dinner!

742
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,583
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

743
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,771
Listen!

744
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,583
Ever had a Dosa at the
5-star hotel next door?

745
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:48,833
You think I'd be able to
digest a 200 rupee Dosa?

746
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,583
And why would I, when I can have
the same thing here for sixteen bucks...

747
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,916
With unlimited chutney!

748
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,708
Some more chutney, please!

749
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:59,500
I've got another appointment, Vir...
So enjoy your Dosa...

750
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:04,291
A 5- star will label this Dosa
'Black gram pancakes with lentil soup'

751
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,125
and sell it to you for 200 bucks.

752
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,583
Here, at a lower cost, it's a win-win
for both customer and seller.

753
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,708
Same ingredients, same quality,
same cleanliness...

754
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,375
Then why such a difference in cost?

755
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,916
Because they have fewer overheads.

756
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,166
My airline too will have
minimum overheads, sir.

757
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:26,125
Newspaper, meals, water -
ten percent of the ticket cost...

758
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,791
I won't provide any of it.

759
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,458
And I won't charge
flyers for it either.

760
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:32,500
India's moving at a fast pace, sir.

761
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:37,208
People just want to go from
one city to another for work.

762
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:41,041
They don't need meals
on a one hour flight.

763
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,500
We'll reduce the weight on the flight.

764
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,166
There will be no extra food or staff.

765
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:50,016
Big airlines do two trips a day,
we'll do six!

766
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:52,708
But how? There are rules, Vir!

767
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,375
According to the rules,

768
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,708
Pilots cannot fly for
more than eight hours a day.

769
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,375
A day has twenty four hours.

770
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,708
Safety checks, cleaning, fueling
for six flights, six times a day.

771
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,750
That would take six hours.
What do we have left?

772
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,583
We still get eighteen hours
of flying time.

773
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:12,208
If each flight takes two hours,
we can do six trips in twelve hours.

774
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,208
That still leaves us with
six hours of flying time.

775
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:18,083
Our pilots will fly in three shifts.

776
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:21,625
Every flight of ours will have
not two, but six pilots.

777
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,083
Sir, humans get tired.
Aircrafts don't.

778
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:29,458
But... this has never been attempted.

779
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:30,791
Exactly.

780
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:32,958
What if I say no?

781
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:36,125
You'll only be the 21st investor
to call me a crazy fool and shoo me off.

782
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,500
I'll find a 22nd one to pitch to.

783
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:41,250
Sir, look around you.

784
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,333
Not one seat empty,
not one waiter standing idle.

785
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:48,267
Our aircraft will be
a flying Udupi restaurant.

786
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:49,625
[phone ringing]

787
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,041
Hello?

788
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,833
Yes.

789
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,416
Sir, the bill.

790
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,583
[Prakash] Vir!

791
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:10,875
I'm travelling for four months.

792
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:15,541
[Prakash] When I come back,
pitch this to the Fundflow board.

793
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:20,708
And if they laugh at me
after hearing your crazy idea...

794
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,791
[Prakash] You'll owe me another Dosa!

795
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,041
Sure, sir! It'll be my pleasure!

796
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,041
Thank you, sir!

797
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:29,575
[uplifting music playing]

798
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:31,666
Hey! What?

799
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,416
I'm still eating.

800
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:35,291
Always in a hurry...

801
00:44:38,627 --> 00:44:40,313
[uplifting music continues]

802
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,916
I need to go to the
village for a few days.

803
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,375
For what?

804
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,125
Vir! Go for it!

805
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,833
Catch it. Let's go.

806
00:44:58,755 --> 00:45:00,341
[uplifting music playing]

807
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,750
[Jagan] Kaveri, we spent our whole
lives on rickety bullock carts...

808
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,625
Let these kids fly!

809
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:14,029
[uplifting music playing]

810
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:21,875
[Mandar] Why are you suddenly obsessing
about that witch after three years?

811
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,833
Who knows if she
even stays here anymore!

812
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:26,250
Hey, stop!
Isn't that her Uncle?

813
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,041
Oh my God!

814
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,083
You're still on a bike!
Where's your airplane?

815
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:32,583
[Mandar] So your bakery has opened!

816
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,583
Won't you offer us a
sample piece of cake?

817
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,916
Buy what you want!
No freebies here!

818
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:39,875
Let them have cake, uncle.

819
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,416
Give them some biscuits too.

820
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,333
To dip in hot tea, you know.

821
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,541
Here.

822
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,166
Got married yet?

823
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,500
Yeah, have a kid too. Look.

824
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:52,958
Hey, give us a smile.

825
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:54,541
How about you?

826
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:57,083
- We're here to see a girl.
- With a pipe?

827
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:59,166
That's why we stopped to buy cake.

828
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,208
- How could we go empty-handed?
- Is she a plumber?

829
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,416
Holy cow!

830
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,666
Three years, and you're
still meeting girls?

831
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,875
What about your airline?

832
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,574
I've found a Venture Capitalist.

833
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,583
Once our meeting happens,
it will take off.

834
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,041
So you're still at the first step!

835
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,750
You know what?
Forget about aeroplanes.

836
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:22,916
Get an auto-rickshaw!
Zip through the three steps!

837
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:27,000
Hey Mandar, let's go!

838
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,416
We'll find other bakeries on the way.

839
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,708
- Come on, stop hogging!
- You won't!

840
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,333
There's no other bakery in this area!

841
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,958
Not surprising!
It's a shitty location for a bakery!

842
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,041
If you opened it opposite
a school or college,

843
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,250
there would have been a long queue!
Get it?

844
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,666
Yeah, whatever! Move on!

845
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,375
- Hey, Uncle!
- Move aside!

846
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:48,375
Let's move, you ass!

847
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,166
- [Rani] Get an auto-rickshaw!
- She's as cocky as ever...

848
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:52,791
And a liar too!

849
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,833
She has no husband or kids!

850
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,958
How do you know?

851
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,875
Her uncle just gave it away!

852
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,625
Who will marry her anyway?

853
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,083
Let's go.

854
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,541
Come on bro, move!

855
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,041
Whether it's your Birthday
or anniversary...

856
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,333
For every occasion,
there's Rani Bakery!

857
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,416
Milk cake for your girl,
and fruit cake for your mom!

858
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:17,155
[hooligans jeering]

859
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,375
Eat sweets and talk sweet!

860
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:22,041
Two cakes for the price of one!

861
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:25,125
Milk cake for your girl,
Fruitcake for your mum!

862
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:26,458
Hey Honey-bun!

863
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,541
Why did you lie about
being married with a kid?

864
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,500
Eat sweets and talk sweet!

865
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,666
Buy one and get one free!

866
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,416
Listen Honey-bun!

867
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,666
Look...

868
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,666
You're a weirdo, and so am I.

869
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,791
No one's going to
marry weirdos like us.

870
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:46,833
Why don't we marry each other?
What do you say?

871
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:48,305
[hooligans laughing]

872
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:51,666
Eat cake and make merry!
Come, hurry to Rani Bakery!

873
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,916
Hey, Honey-bun!

874
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,333
Why did it take you three years
to remember this weirdo?

875
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:59,333
My village land was barren.

876
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,792
It's turning green now.

877
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:02,958
And my airline should
take off soon too!

878
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:04,433
Come on, say yes!

879
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:06,000
And what if your airline fails?

880
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,208
What if your airline fails?

881
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,916
Well, we'll still have Rani Bakery!
It's doing well, right?

882

Hey, Honey-bun! Say something?

885
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,416
I have three conditions.

886
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:25,125
Oh God, Rani!
He's come all the way...

887
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:28,875
Number one - I don't want
any squabbling over money.

888
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:32,125
'Your money, my money'...
Whatever we have, will be ours.

889
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,458
Ok.

890
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,041
Number two - My work is
no less important than yours.

891
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,791
If I'm busy, I'm busy.

892
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,166
Ok.

893
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,166
And number three...

894
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,541
If I start a family with someone,
they'll be the most important to me.

895
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,666
If you put our family in danger,

896
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,250
I'll mix rat poison in your food.

897
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:52,808
Ok.

898
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,958
Go. Think it over.

899
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,666
I've already decided.

900
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:01,583
- I won't give you a divorce later!
- I won't ask for one!

901
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,750
- Ok.
- Ok!

902
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,166
Yes, Mhatre!

903
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,666

three years ago...

904

What made you say
okay so quickly now?

905
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,000
Sometimes, you just know...

906
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,291
that whether it's ten minutes
or ten years,

907
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:16,166
your decision won't change.

908
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,625
So why waste time?

909
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:20,583
Using my line on me, smartypants!

910
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,208
Come one, come all to Rani Bakery!

American Airlines reduced

943
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:45,750
225 kilos means, the plane can
accommodate four more passengers.

That's ok,

968

but how will this be profitable?

969
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,166
The Government run Hindustan Airlines
is already running losses.

970
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,291
- Worth almost 10 billion, right?
- Yes.

971
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:03,791
And you want to sell tickets
at half the price of the competition?

972
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,750
But sir,
if you see our pricing structure,

973
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:09,250
my competition isn't Hindustan Airlines,
but the Indian Railways...

974
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,041
And that's running profits!

975

00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,000

- 900 million?

977
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,916
900 million.

978
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:22,083
And you plan to start a whole airline
with a budget of 100 million?

979
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:24,333
Who says we need to buy planes?

980
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:28,458
We need to lease them.
We'll rent planes.

981
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,708
Really? Which company will lease out
their planes at this price?

982
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,416
- American Airways!
- American Airways?

983
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,100
After the Twin tower attacks,

984
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,584
their airline business
has suffered big losses.

985
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,666
They're selling their planes
at half the price.

986
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:44,583
We can take advantage of that
and lease their planes!

987
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,667
And what if our revenue
is less than expected?

988
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,291
We'll have to shut the company!

even sixty percent full,

990
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,708
we can break even

993
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,678
But what if we don't even
achieve sixty percent occupancy?

994
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,541
Sir, what's the airfare
from Mumbai to Delhi?

995
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,978
- Twelve thousand.
- Twelve thousand.

996
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:09,416
Average occupancy sixty percent, right?

997
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,875
If other airlines can sell
tickets for twelve thousand rupees

998
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,125
and get sixty percent occupancy,

999
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:21,041
By selling tickets for six thousand rupees,
we can do better than sixty percent!

1000
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,791
You are forgetting one key thing.

1001
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:27,041
People who travel by train
aren't used to buying flight tickets.

1002
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,958
- It's a mental hurdle.
- Absolutely.

1003
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,673
But sir, more people traveling
will mean more business,

1004
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:34,541
which means more job requirements,

1005
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,541
which means even more travelers.

1006
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:42,291
We might have to increase
our flights per day from five to fifty!

1007
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:47,291
Once it becomes a habit,
the average train passenger

1008
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,250
will fly more than a frequent flyer.

There's one issue though...

It's a public limited company,
shareholders' money is involved...

1024
00:55:33,975 --> 00:55:39,291
It will take three to six months
for the funds to be released.

1025

Sir, getting the DGCA licence
will take the same amount of time.

1026
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:46,416
That's what I'm really worried about, Vir.

1027
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:50,708
In the meantime, what if
American Airways' rates go up,

1028
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:54,916
Or if someone else gets the same idea?

1029
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,375
I'll tell you what...
Book three aircrafts.

1030
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,791
By the time you get the licence,

1031
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:04,875
get the painting and stickering
of the aircrafts done in Malaysia.

1032
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,291
But to book the aircrafts,

1033
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:09,125
we'll have to pay American Airways
a 4.7 million advance...

1034
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,416
Can you raise the money
on your own?

1035
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,916
I can get a loan
against my mother's land.

Are you sure?

1050
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:04,041
Lunch break for an hour.
Everyone eat and come back!

1051

Hello! Captain Vir Jagannath Mhatre, sir.

1054

Prakash Babu asked me to meet you!

1055
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,916
Hi, yes Mr. Mhatre!

1056
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:33,166
- I saw your proposal. It's interesting.
- Thank you.

1057
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:36,750
But can we do this tomorrow?
I need to leave early today.

1058
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:41,041
Sure, sir.
Everything okay, thank you.

1060
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,125
Hello, sir!

1061
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:55,875
Did you fix an appointment
with the new Civil Aviation Minister?

[somber music playing]

1063
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:06,125
- Hello, sir.
- Oh! Mr. Vir, right?

1064
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,541
Actually, I have an urgent meeting
with the new Civil Aviation Minister.

1065
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:12,166
Tomorrow, for sure!
We'll finish it off.

1066
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,708
Sir, the meeting will
happen today, right?

1067
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,416
Oh, no!

1068
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,125
Mr. Deshmukh's on leave now.
Come back next week.

1069
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,583
Why didn't you tell me
this yesterday?

1070
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:36,583
You took three months
just to give me an appointment!

1071
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,333
You're his PA,
don't you know his schedule?

1072
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,916
I'm just telling you
what I've been asked to say, sir.

1073
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,375
Even Mr. Ratan came here,
waited and left.

1074
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,875
His airline never started.

1075
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:47,666
Who do you think you are?

1076
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,583
I'm bleeding money
every passing day, sir...

1077
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,416
Try to understand, please!

1078

Small fry can't swim against sharks.

If my airline takes off,
you'll get free tickets for a lifetime.

For your entire family!
But only domestic flights.

1105

I'll buy them on my own!

What advice would you give us
in order to achieve something?

1125
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,708
[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]
Actually, it's very simple.

1126
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,250
All you need is four things.

1127
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,000
Only four things.

1128
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,458
Number one - Aim!

1129
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:21,541
Focus on your goal,
don't let anything distract you.

1130
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:24,041
Number two - Knowledge.

1131
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:27,888
Gather as much knowledge as you can.

1132
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,748
Number three - Hard work.

1133
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:35,000
Number four - Perseverance. Determination.

1134
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:39,000
If you have these four things,

1135
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:41,750
any citizen of this country
can achieve anything they want.

1136
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,541
No, sir! There's a fifth thing too!

1137
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,433
Excuse me!

1138
01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:48,583
Questions from the media
aren't allowed right now.

Which publication are you from?

1140

A chance! Opportunity, sir.

1141
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,250
The citizens of our country
need opportunities.

1142
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,000
Just those four things aren't enough!

1143
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:00,375
The common man needs
an opportunity to dream.

1144

No matter how hard these kids work,

1145
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:08,083
without opportunities,
they won't get anywhere!

1146
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,000
All I want is one chance, sir!

1147
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:14,083
I want to start this country's
first low-cost airline.

1148
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:17,750
I want every common man to
be able to touch the skies!

1149
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:21,750
To at least be able to meet
their dying father one last time!

1150
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,166
Sir, please listen to me!

1151

I'm from a village near Jarandeshwar.

My father was a schoolteacher there.

- Vir.
- What happened, Ma?

1159
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:52,333
Your father is very unwell.

1160

He's just waiting for you...

01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:06,416
He wants to see his son
before he dies.

1164

I'll be there in the morning.

- Yes, yes...

How much- how much time
do I have to buy the ticket?

Five minutes. Sir please, there are
people waiting in the queue!

01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:26,291
The flight will leave.

1216
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:29,375
Please. I just need 5200 rupees.

1217
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:32,916
Anybody! Anybody please...
I'll give you my home address.

1218
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:36,291
Here, see. This is my father.
He's very sick.

1219
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,916
Mhatre House,

1220
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,500
Pin - 415011...

1221
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:46,166
Here. I promise,
I'll pay the money back.

1222
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,166
- Just 5200 rupees!
- Security! What is this?

1223
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:49,583
People are begging
in an airport now!

1224
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:53,541
No, I don't want charity.
I'm asking for a loan.

1225
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,791
Just 5200 rupees.
Please try and understand!

1226
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,500
Please leave from here.
Security, take him!

1227
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:00,541
- Please, please!
- Hurry up and take him away.

1228
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,333
The flight will leave.
My father is very serious!

1229
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:07,583
Please, for my mother's sake!
She's old, she has no one else!

1230
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,250
It's very important, please...
Someone help me!

1231
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:14,083
Sir! Sir please try and understand!

1232
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,697
[engine stalling]

1233
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,666
What happened?

1234
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,125
It looks like something is wrong.
I will have to check.

1235
01:06:35,393 --> 01:06:37,533
[nostalgic music playing]

1236
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,500
You're a coward!

1237
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,708
A defeated and jaded coward!

1238
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,959
And you'll remain one all your life!

1239
01:06:47,427 --> 01:06:49,220

[Vir] <i>Down with the Government!</i>

[Mandar] <i>Vir!</i>

01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:39,000

Vir!

1251
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:17,916
Ma...

1252
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,791
Ma, I'm here...

1253
01:08:28,585 --> 01:08:30,252
Don't be angry with me...

1254
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,077
[Vir sobbing]

1255
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,291
I told you, didn't I?

1256
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,993
That your father can't die
in peace without seeing you?

1257
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:46,208
His life slipped away while he was
staring at the door!

1258
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,666
What could I have done?

1259
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,916
The body had started to rot...
We had to cremate him!

1260
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:04,333
Despite having a son,
someone else did his last rites!

1261
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,416
Like an unclaimed corpse!

1262
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:11,583
"Vir, Vir, Vir..."
He died crying out your name!

1263
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,458
But Vir only cares about his ego!

1264
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:20,041
No! No, Ma...

1265
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,750
Why are you here now?

1266
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:26,375
Have you no shame?

1267
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,273
[Kaveri sobs]

1268
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,708
Look, see what your father thinks of you!

1269
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,958
Read!

1270
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:38,083
Take a look!

1271
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:43,333
"Vir left home today."

1272
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:46,166
"I'm sure he'll make it big!"

1273
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,041
"He's a fighter, unlike me."

1274
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:53,083
"Vir is right.
I really am a coward."

1275
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,875
Read the other one!

1276
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,208
"If Vir says he'll make
the villagers fly on a plane,"

1277
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,708
"then I'm sure he'll do it!"

1278
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,291
"He's a man of his word!"

1279
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,166
Your father always said,

1280
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,500
time is the most precious thing.

1281
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:21,750
A person who doesn't value time,
can't possibly value relationships!

1282
01:10:22,933 --> 01:10:24,127
Dad...

1283
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:28,625
Ma...

1284
01:10:29,477 --> 01:10:30,597
[both sobbing]

1285
01:10:30,597 --> 01:10:33,916
Ma, I didn't have enough money...

1286
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:39,916
I tried really hard to come soon,
but I couldn't, ma...

1287
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,916
Please forgive me...

1288
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:46,458
I wasn't angry with Dad...

1289
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:51,291
I just didn't have money, Ma!

1290
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,166
Forgive me!

1291
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,750
Dad...

1292
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:59,416
Dad, please forgive me!

1293
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:04,916
It's not what you think, Dad...
I'm still your son...

1294
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,625
Please forgive me, Dad!

1295
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:13,000
Since the last three years,
all I've dreamt of day and night...

1296
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:20,041
is to enable every citizen
of this country to fly.

1297
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,125
Did we refuse you a licence?

1298
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,250
You went straight to the President!

1299
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:30,542
Sir, meeting the President
was easier than meeting you!

1300
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:33,833
Anyway...

1301
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,187

[upbeat music continues playing]

1303
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,791
- Mr. Walia!
- Hey, Trivedi!

1304
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:10,416
Your airline Red Magpie is
expanding its flight sectors...

1305
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,375
Given the current state of
Indian aviation,

1306
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,875
do you think this
is a wise decision?

1307
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,291
Aviation Minister Nakul Parekh
has gone on record to say

1308
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,375
that the Government won't bail
you out under any circumstances.

1309
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,916
If I take a girl out,

1310
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,250
I won't just take her
for dinner, will I?

1311
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,750
I'll have dessert too!

1312
01:12:23,895 --> 01:12:25,275
[reporters laugh]

1313
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,041
Risk is the kick, man!

1314
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,916
I'll never need a bailout.

1315
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,333
What's our brewery business for,
after all?

1316
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,958
What's the big deal about this
'Aero show'?

1317
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,083
It's just like our village fair!

1318
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,583
Only the toys here are a little bigger!

1319
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,291
- Will ours be like that one?
- No, like that one.

1320
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,208
- Can we see it up close?
- No!

1321
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:49,583
Only VIPs can go there,
those who own the aircrafts.

1322
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,791
Our planes are still in Malaysia.

1323
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,041
Chaitanya will bring them.

1324
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,166
Once they're here,
you can inspect them inside-out!

1325
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:58,208
Hi, Paresh!

1326
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,500
Jaz Airways is going to
increase its flights, is it?

1327
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,750
You know, I don't take risks...
I'm purchasing Turboprops.

1328
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:05,958
For the Cargo fleet.

1329
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,083
That's your man there.

1330
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,599
What's happened to
Prakash Babu's business sense?

1331
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:13,846
Partnering with that nut- job...

1332
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:17,208
Master and Disciple -
out to create history!

1333
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:19,083
Oh, is that the stud?

1334
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:21,708
The one who wants to turn
the sky into a roadside market?

1335
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:23,375
He'll fall flat on his face.

1336
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:28,375
Walia, a bumblebee has
tiny wings and a big body.

1337
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:32,083
According to the rules of aerodynamics,
it shouldn't be able to fly.

1338
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,125
But it flies. Why?

1339
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:37,208
Because no one told the bee that it can't.

1340
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,791
But this insect needs to be told.

1341
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,792
[pager beeping]

1342
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,166
Chaitanya. "Call me!"

1343
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,958
[Che] Vir, American Airways has
canceled our deal!

1344
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,208
The Indian DGCA guys are
asking for the plane blueprints!

1345
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:58,416
- Blueprints, why?
- I don't know Vir.

1346
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,791
They've never asked any company
for blueprints till date.

1347
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:01,833
Why are they doing this to us?

1348
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,625
They said, go ask the Indian DGCA
why they are doing this!

1349
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,791
[Che] <i>American Airways is taking
our planes back!</i>

1350
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,791
<i>And they've imposed a 5 million fine
on us for blocking their planes!</i>

1351
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,708
Why is the Indian government
targeting just us?

1352
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:14,416
- Hey, mister!
- I'll pay, don't worry.

1353

[suspenseful music playing]

1354
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,375
You go ahead. I'll manage!

1355

[suspenseful music continues]

1356
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:45,375
What are these new rules, sir?

1357
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,583
How can plane manufacturers
share their blueprints?

1358
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,541
No company ever reveals
its trade secrets!

1359
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:51,083
This rule is unfair!

1360
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:55,958
We've been slapped with a 5 million fine
because of this rule.

1361
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:57,541
- Please do something, sir!
- That's not my problem.

1362
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,333
I can't break the rules
just for you, can I?

1363
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,875
But you can instantly make rules
to benefit some people.

1364
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,125
You could go to the President again.

1365
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:08,000
Running an airline is
for big shots.

1366
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:10,250
Go back to your village
and ride a bullock cart!

1367
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,291
And you continue being
Paresh's little lackey, you scoundrel!

1368
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,041
Just because a man is silent,
you think you can walk all over him?

1369
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,625
You're assaulting a Government servant!

1370
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,791
Here! I'm drowning that servant.

1371
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:22,625
Move! Get out!

1372
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:24,590
[intense music playing]

1373
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:30,541
- Prakash sir!
- Vir! What are you doing here?

1374
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:32,291
Sir, we have a big problem.

1375
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,750
DGCA changed their by-laws
at the last moment.

1376
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,374
They want the aircraft blueprints!

1377
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:38,708
American Airways has cancelled our deal.

1378
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:39,766
And they've imposed a penalty too!

1379
01:15:39,766 --> 01:15:41,458
Sir I need a 5 million advance
from you please.

1380
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,666
Or else Deccan Air will crash
even before it has taken off.

1381
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:48,334
6.4738 billion!

1382
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,375
No sir, 5 million.

1383
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:55,375
That is the revenue of
Jaz's travel agency.

1384
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:57,625
Per year!

1385
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:03,625
And you went to him with an idea
that would kill all that revenue.

1386
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,458
Paresh Goswami rules Indian aviation.

1387
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,291
In fact, Paresh Goswami
is Indian aviation.

1388
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:14,541
Everyone is in his pocket.

1389

1390
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,541

is Paresh Goswami.

1393
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:35,000
He only paid attention
to you for ten minutes...

1394
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:39,125
And all your dreams
of flying in the sky

1395
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,250
went crashing down into the sewer.

1396
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:46,501
Your life will go by,
just paying off the loan.

1397
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:51,833
Don't invite his attention again.

1398

I told you not to
marry that madman!

1425
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,000
But you just love stressing out
your parents, don't you?

1426
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,833
What big talk,
flying planes and all...

1427
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:12,208
And now he sits at home,
living off your earnings!

1428
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:13,875
Does he feel no shame?

1429
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,000
Tell the cow to shut up.

1430
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,625
Been shouting all morning!

1431
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:20,209
What? You have a cow?

1432
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:21,875
She's calling me one!

1433
01:20:22,792 --> 01:20:24,709
Fine, I'll leave! I got you this.

1434
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,792
Your husband can't provide
for you anyway.

1435
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,083
Take the saree. I don't want it.

1436

Get up, let's go!

1437
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:34,125
Keep the cake.

1438
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:36,708
- Leave it!
- Let's go!

1439
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,917
So much attitude,
as if she's married a King!

1440
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:40,792
You could have at least
let me finish my cake.

01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:43,292
Haven't you seen a
cake before? Just go!

When did you get back?

1444
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:12,000
Our neighbour Firoz Uncle
brought us special pudding for Eid.

1445
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:16,625
Both his daughters are appearing
for the civil services exams this year.

1446

He's really stressed out.

1447
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:23,542
And tuitions are so
expensive these days.

1448
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:28,541
He asked me if you would
be willing to coach them...

1449
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,083
And he doesn't want you
to do it for free!

1450
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:34,583
I told him that
I'll ask you and get back.

1451
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,458
Didn't take you much time.

1452
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,263
For what?

1453
01:21:38,263 --> 01:21:40,375
To tell me that I'm a burden on you.

[serious music playing]

1455
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,625
Did I say that?

1456
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:51,625
Then say it! Be straightforward!

1457
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,083
Your mom's right.

1458
01:21:55,558 --> 01:21:57,725
When you're hungry,
your temper goes out of--

1459
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:59,583
Don't coddle me, I'm not a child!

1460
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:02,083
At least your mom straight up
called me a loser and left!

1461
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,792
So now you'll vent
that anger on me?

1462
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:09,475
Let's plan our way ahead!

1463
01:22:09,475 --> 01:22:12,250
Why don't you plan it!
You're running this house anyway.

1464
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,208
Maybe you can tell me
how to start an airline too!

1465
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,792
It's not like baking a cupcake.
Throw in some flour, sugar, butter

1466
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:19,833
and you're all set!

1467
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:25,000
For your investors,
your idea's a cupcake too.

1468
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,625
And don't forget that this house
is running thanks to those cupcakes!

1469

01:29:04,515 --> 01:29:05,932
So they consume less fuel.

1561
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,458
But a small plane would fit
fewer passengers, right?

1562
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:10,792
Yes, but how many passengers
do other airlines require

1563
01:29:10,917 --> 01:29:12,500
to run at full capacity? 200.

1564
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:14,500
We'll need only 70! That's it!

1565
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:17,417
If our tickets cost half
the price of other airlines,

1566
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:18,791
people will definitely come.

1567
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,791
And all flights will soon...

1568
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:23,042
Become full! Right!

1569
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:24,583
That sounds great.

1570
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:26,126
But how do we get these...
Turbo-pops?

1571
01:29:26,292 --> 01:29:29,042
The Turboprop company's planes
used to be passenger planes.

1572
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,167
But when business went downhill,
they began to use them for cargo.

1573
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:35,000
We'll turn them into
passenger planes again!

1574
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,875
We'll offer Turboprop a joint venture.
Fifty percent partnership!

1575
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:40,458
It's an offer they can't refuse!

1576
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,958
Mr. Mhatre, a fifty percent partnership
is out of question.

1577
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:46,042
We're already leading
in the small planes market.

1578
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:47,667
No ma'am you are not.

1579
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,167
Right now, all your passenger planes
are flying as cargo planes.

1580
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:54,167
I'm saying we will turn them
back into passenger planes.

1581
01:29:54,292 --> 01:29:57,208
But sir, these small planes
can't fly such long distances.

1582
01:29:58,375 --> 01:29:59,292
One minute.

1583
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:03,250
You know how during the winters,
small birds migrate over 20,000 miles?

1584
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,750
- How do they do it?
- By making stops.

1585
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,250
Exactly!

1586
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,500
Our small planes will also
make pit stops.

1587
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:14,708
So a plane from Vijaywada to Delhi
can halt at Bhopal and Nagpur. Right?

1588
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:16,625
Short flights. Big connectivity!

1589
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,292
And what if we don't get flyers?

1590
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:21,208
Ma'am, India has the biggest
middle-class in the world.

1591
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,458
16 Million people travel by train
per day.

1592
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:26,583
And another 12 million by road.

1593
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:30,417
For us to run full capacity,
out of these 28 Million people,

1594
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:33,083
we need only two percent Ma'am.
Just two percent.

1595
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,958
Mr. Mhatre, let's do it!

1596
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,292
Thank you Ma'am,

1597
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,375
Bro!

1598
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,293
[Everyone cheering]

1599
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,625
You owe me 800 rupees
for tea this month.

1600
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,834
Come on, uncle!
We're talking about 80 million,

1601
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:48,917
and you're whining about 800 bucks!

1602
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,125
Put it on the tab!

1603
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:53,713
Don't have 800 bucks in your pocket,
and you're talking of 80 million!

1604
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,333
You need money to make money!

1605
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:09,083
Shall we grab some vada-pav?
I'm craving it since morning!

1606
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,625
You were going to do
accounts today, right?

1607
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:13,500
- Is it done?
- Yeah.

1608
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:15,667
Is everything okay?

1609
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:19,708
Honestly, even if we made 200-300,
I'd be satisfied.

1610
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,416
But we're making a thousand!

1611
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:24,250
A thousand! In a week?

1612
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:26,000
In a day!

1613
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:28,792
All the girls from the college
across the road come to have cake...

1614
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,083
And all the boys follow,
to woo them with cakes!

1615
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:32,792
It's such a great location!

1616
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,500
Whose idea was it?

1617
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:38,416
Yeah, I'm sure you must have
tried to woo girls with cake too.

1618
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,542
That's how you got the idea, right?

1619
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,125
Mhatre!

1620
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:48,042
Brother! Two vada-pavs,
and one tea, with extra sugar.

1621
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:49,292
[Vada-pav seller] Ok.

1622
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,083
Here you go.

1623
01:31:51,292 --> 01:31:52,833
[Bystander] Brother, a vada-pav please.

1624
01:31:57,792 --> 01:32:00,083
- No, I don't want it.
- What happened?

1625
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:02,417
Tell me.

1626
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,792
Go on.

1627
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:07,167
Paresh is out of India for a month.

1628
01:32:07,292 --> 01:32:09,958
If we submit our papers
to the Ministry quickly,

1629
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,208
we can get our planes to India
before he comes back.

1630
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:14,542
If he's around, he'll surely
mess with our plans.

1631
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:17,625
- You're right.
- I have prepared everything.

1632
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:21,167
The security manual is ready,
I have an ok from Turboprop as well.

1633
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:24,333
Then get the planes.
What's the problem?

1634
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Rani, we need to register the company.

1635
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:30,875
If you could lend me
fifteen thousand rupees...

1636
01:32:32,663 --> 01:32:34,310
[serious music playing]

1637
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,250
Rani, if the Turboprop deal
gets closed somehow...

1638
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,000
This time the company
will definitely take off.

1639
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:42,333
And in three months,
I can pay you back!

1640
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,000
Take the money from him.

1641
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:57,042
Its four and a half rupees.

1642
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:00,750
Rani!

1643
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,917
Rani listen. Rani!

1644
01:33:05,023 --> 01:33:06,830
[serious music continues]

1645
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,667
Not fifteen...

1646
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,583
Take twenty thousand.

1647
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,667
You always dream so big,
petty talk doesn't suit you.

1648
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:27,500
Feeling embarrassed for taking money
from your own wife?

1649
01:33:28,445 --> 01:33:30,358
[hopeful music playing]

1650
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,708
I'll take that, sir.

1651
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:35,458
Sorry.

1652
01:33:38,834 --> 01:33:41,167
Didn't I tell you?
There's no 'yours' or 'mine'.

1653
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:46,000
All my cakes are yours.
And all your planes will be mine.

1654
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,333
That was our deal, right?

1655
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:50,125
Right.

1656
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:57,792
Sorry.

1657
01:33:59,962 --> 01:34:03,815
[upbeat music playing]

1658
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:13,333
Now go.

1659
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,542
Go!

1660
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:21,375
Yeah, break it. Break everything!

1661
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:28,107
[music stops]

1662
01:34:29,292 --> 01:34:32,334
What are you staring at?
Show me the accounts!

1663
01:34:55,292 --> 01:34:56,750
Get up! Hey! Get up!

1664
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,792
Sir...

1665
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:01,167
Bloody pauper,
sleeping like he owns the place!

1666
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:03,125
- Sorry, sir.
- Brother!

1667
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:05,875
- What's up? Why are you shouting?
- Nothing...

1668
01:35:06,417 --> 01:35:07,500
Why are you still up?

1669
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:10,583
- It's nothing, don't be silly-
- Bhavar, tell me!

1670
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:12,958
- Is there a problem?
- Come with me...

1671
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:17,292
It's a small issue. I'll manage it.

1672
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:19,458
Bhavar, I've told you
so many times...

1673
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:21,208
I don't care if you don't
give me good news,

1674
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:23,083
but bad news -
tell me immediately!

1675
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:27,417
Turboprop refused the
cargo aircraft deal today.

1676
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,542
Someone has reserved them
for passenger flights.

1677
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:31,833
But don't worry-

1678
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:33,625
Who? Who did it?

1679
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:35,000
I'm finding out...

1680

- Call Deshmukh!
- Brother, it's 3 am!

1681
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,542
So what? I'm awake, aren't I?
I don't care if he's asleep!

1682
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,083
Go, call him!

01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:48,625
One minute... One minute!

1685

- Here it is, sir.
- What is it?

1686
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,458
[Deshmukh] <i>Sir, it's a joint venture between</i>

and VR Aviation Pvt. Ltd.</i>

[Deshmukh] <i>Sir, you were out of India,
so I didn't bother you...</i>

1692
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:14,750
You're the only one who deals
with Turboprop Aviation in India,

1693
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:18,042
I assumed it was just a dummy company
that you created for tax purposes.

1694
01:36:19,042 --> 01:36:24,042
Wow! He managed to outsmart
a man like me!

1695
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:26,458
Don't worry, Mr. Paresh!
He won't be able to do anything.

can't run an airline!</i>

Okay, now what?

1700
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,417
Let them fly!

[Paresh laughing]

1702
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:43,125
How will we fly?

1703
01:36:44,417 --> 01:36:46,208
We still need an
investment of 32.5 million.

1704
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:49,042
Can we cut costs anywhere else?

1705
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:50,167
Vir!

1706
01:36:50,792 --> 01:36:51,958
How's it going?

1707
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:55,167
Every guy on the street
knows about Rani Bakery!

1708
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,833
Your Honeybun has become famous!

1709
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:58,208
Mandar... What brings you here?

1710
01:36:58,333 --> 01:37:01,083
Guess what uncle,
my sister's marriage has been fixed!

1711
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,417
All of you must come.

01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:05,792
Hey Vir, we'll rag the groom together!

1713
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:08,042
She thinks of you as her brother,
even more than me.

1714
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,500
Come two days in advance.

1715
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:11,083
Take charge of feeding the guests.

1716
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,208
Vir... think practically.

1717
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:14,833
How much can we cut costs?

1718
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:16,958
This doesn't make sense.

You guys continue your work.
I'll hang around the corner.

1720

all these colourful pastries...

1721
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,375

01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,000
Stop being a freeloader!

Fine, you can have some
since you travelled so far.

1724

I've tried everything, man.

1725
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,375
This is the minimum we need.

1726
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:31,333
It looks impossible.

1727
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:33,375
We shouldn't have rushed
into the deal with Turboprop--

01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:34,792
What else could we have done?

1729
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:37,792
Your father-in-law is right!

1730
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,917
You give up even before trying!

1731
01:37:40,035 --> 01:37:42,368
All you can do is chant,
'impossible, impossible!'

1732
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,542
Go to hell!

1733
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:45,823
[somber music playing]

1734
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:49,250
Hey Sam...

1735
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:50,875
Don't mind him, okay?

1736
01:37:52,917 --> 01:37:53,958
It's okay, Uncle.

1737
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:57,792
He's just stressed about the money.

1738
01:37:58,625 --> 01:38:01,417
But I know, he'll figure out something.

1739
01:38:04,417 --> 01:38:07,083
These three have invested
their entire lives' savings into this.

1740
01:38:07,542 --> 01:38:09,792
How will they get 32.5 million more?

1741
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:14,250
Hey, if I had the money,
I'd give it to you.

1742
01:38:26,792 --> 01:38:29,125
Sir, how much is it?

1743
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:33,958
Vir, normally I would directly
inform the Income Tax Department...

1744
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:36,750
But I wanted to check with you first.

1745
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,250
Look.

1746
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:42,375
Rupees 1,50,000... 20,000...
1,00,000... 10,000...

1747
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,959
Various amounts are being deposited
from Jarandeshwar into your account.

1748
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:48,083
Since yesterday.

1749
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:49,667
Another transaction just happened.

1750
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:52,042
What's going on, Vir?

1751
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:56,792
Sir, can I make a phone call?

1752
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:57,958
Sure.

1753
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:04,750
Vir! Did you get the money?

1754
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,833
<i>We've postponed Sayali's wedding a bit...</i>

1755
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:09,625
The boy is mad about her!
He'll wait.

1756
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:10,958
Are you crazy, Mandar?

1757
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,334
[Mandar] <i>Speak to Uncle Sharad.</i>

1758
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:14,875
Vir! You got the money, right?

1759
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:16,958
I've sent you 2,00,000.

1760
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,292
Uncle... Where did you get
so much money from?

1761
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:24,000
From the money-lender, of course!
I've signed off my land as collateral.

1762
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,500
Don't you worry!

1763
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,708
Why did you give your land
to that leech, Uncle!

1764
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:31,875
Ever since we got train connectivity,
our land's value increased twenty-fold.

1765
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Thanks to whom?

1766
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:34,375
You!

1767
01:39:35,292 --> 01:39:37,292
You've done so much
for our village,

1768
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:39,333
and you expect us to
turn our backs on you?

1769
01:39:39,458 --> 01:39:40,292
No way, buddy!

1770
01:39:40,417 --> 01:39:42,583
[Mandar] One minute, speak to Uncle...

1771
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:46,625
Vir, the crops failed this year,
only the chillies did well.

1772
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:50,208
I'm sending you 500 rupees, son.
Did you get the money?

1773
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:51,417
Why, Uncle?

1774
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,000
Vir! Speak to Gauri.

1775
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:54,083
Vir Uncle!

1776
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:55,500
Yes, Gauri... tell me.

1777
01:39:55,792 --> 01:39:58,542
[Gauri] <i>Vir uncle, I broke open my piggy bank.</i>

1778
01:39:58,667 --> 01:40:01,000
<i>When will you take me on a plane ride?</i>

1779
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:03,500
[Mandar] <i>Day 3 of our Airplane fund!</i>

1780
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:06,042
<i>Contribute what you can,
no amount is too small!</i>

1781
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:08,958
<i>And irrespective,
please eat before you leave!</i>

1782
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,167
<i>We've organised tea and snacks!</i>

1783
01:40:11,417 --> 01:40:15,208
Rupees 20,000... 10,000... 31,000...

1784
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:18,250
Not 31, 000, it's 3.1 million, dumbo!

1785
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:22,875
Vir, you go get your planes.

1786
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:26,250
We'll have Sayali's wedding party
on a plane then!

1787
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:27,917
[Mandar] <i>Up in the clouds.</i>

1788
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:29,167
Listen to me.

1789
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:30,708
I can't accept this money.

1790
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:33,833
Go to that loan shark right away
and get everyone's land back.

1791
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:36,000
Or I'll come there myself.
Got it?

1792
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:37,208
[Kaveri] <i>Vir!</i>

1793
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:39,125
<i>There's nothing you can do</i>

1794
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:41,917
If you're a stubborn man's son,
I'm his wife!

1795
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:44,417
[Kaveri] <i>I went to the lender yesterday
with everyone's papers.</i>

1796
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:47,542
He won't return the land
without six months' interest.

1797
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:50,417
So don't think of all this now.
Go, do your job.

1798
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:52,833
Son, the entire village is with you.

1799
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:55,083
Your father is with you.

1800
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:58,125
Remember what he said?

1801
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,208
"Vir is a man of his word!"

1802
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,917
[Kaveri] <i>Now go make him proud!</i>

1803
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,833
<i>Make him proud, son!</i>

1804
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:11,833
You will, won't you?

1805
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:14,292
Yes, Ma.

1806
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:16,250
That's it. Go, fly!

1807
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:18,125
Go, fly!

1808
01:41:20,667 --> 01:41:23,542
Vir will make it happen!

1809
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:27,375
Mr. Vir, Paresh controls
all the airstrips in India.

1810
01:41:27,917 --> 01:41:29,250
Where do you plan to land your planes?

1811
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,333
Very much here, sir.

1812
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:31,750
Here? This is it?

1813
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:33,375
These airstrips were used
in the British era,

1814
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,542
for postal deliveries
and diplomatic trips.

1815
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:37,708
But Vir, look at the condition!

1816
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:41,833
How do you plan to run an airline
with three old, out of use airstrips?

1817
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:43,958
Not three, sir.
Five hundred airstrips.

1818
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,708
- Five hundred?
- Yes.

1819
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:51,792
<i>Let them burn with envy</i>

1820
01:41:51,792 --> 01:41:53,833
<i>With a bang, I shall arrive</i>

1821
01:41:53,833 --> 01:41:56,458
<i>Kicking sand in your eyes</i>

1822
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,292
Speak to Ma.

1823
01:41:58,417 --> 01:41:59,292
What?

1824
01:41:59,417 --> 01:42:01,083
We're calling it Deccan Air.

1825
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:03,000
Excellent!

1826
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,625
<i>If you clap with me</i>

1827
01:42:05,432 --> 01:42:07,358
[music continues playing]

1828
01:42:12,583 --> 01:42:16,083
<i>This loser's now on top</i>

1829
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:20,083
<i>If someone gives you a push
give him a hard shove</i>

1830
01:42:20,292 --> 01:42:22,625
If a passenger has a credit card,

1831
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,458
they can book a ticket online
through your software.

1832
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:26,833
But Mr. Bill Gates...

1833
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:29,250
How many people in India
have a credit card?

1834
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:30,833
But they have phones, right?

1835
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:33,875
See, they'll call our call centre
and book their tickets.

1836
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,542
And with the PNR number generated,

1837
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:38,292
they can collect the ticket
from a bank or supermarket!

1838
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:40,833
But Vir...

1839
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:42,375
If Interworld made this software,

1840
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,542
it would test it for six months at least.

1841
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:46,792
But we can't afford that, man.

1842
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,208
Are you sure this will work?

1843
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:52,000
[Father-in-law] Yes,
of course it will work!

1844
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,732
[baby crying]

1845
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:59,375
Don't be nervous,
let's do this!

1846
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,542
We want a tiny stall
next to the reservation counter.

1847
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:06,333
Why would we send our passengers
to the competition, Mr. Mhatre?

1848
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:08,833
Look, most of your trains
are always running full.

1849
01:43:08,958 --> 01:43:11,708
In fact, ten to fifteen thousand passengers
are always on waitlists.

1850
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:13,208
They need to travel too.

1851
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:15,875
We will only sell tickets to
passengers who are on the waitlist

1852
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,250
who complain about the railways.

1853
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:19,167
It's a win-win for the
passengers and the railways.

1854
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:20,917
Sir, we can never be your competition.

1855
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:23,833
All the best.

1856
01:43:25,167 --> 01:43:26,250
Congratulations!

1857
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:28,833
You passed the medical exam.
You are fit.

1858
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,958
You can leave. Next!

1859
01:43:31,843 --> 01:43:33,810

<i>He might look innocent
but he's got nerves of steel</i>

1866
01:44:04,167 --> 01:44:05,792
Deccan Air won't find pilots.

1867
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:09,417
We offered double the salary.
All of them flocked here.

1868
01:44:10,792 --> 01:44:12,833
Fire all of them after a month.

1869
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:14,458
Why?

1870
01:44:14,667 --> 01:44:17,667
People whose loyalties are for
sale can be bought by anyone.

1871
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:26,583
Vir! Not one of our pilots turned up!
There's something fishy for sure.

1872
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:29,250
Nothing to be surprised about.
Paresh is capable of anything.

1873
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:30,792
And so are we!

1874
01:44:31,958 --> 01:44:33,708
[Vir] Retired Air Force officers.

1875
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:35,333
[Uncle] They're retired!

1876
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:37,833
How can these oldies
fly aeroplanes?

1877
01:44:38,042 --> 01:44:41,542
Uncle, the retirement age for
Air Force pilots is 57...

1878
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:44,000
But for Civilian Pilots, it's 61!

1879
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:47,625
They can fly for 4 more years!

1880
01:44:50,792 --> 01:44:52,542
[Vir] Captain Rajiv Manohar.

1881
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:54,625
He co-ordinated everything.

Hello. Investor Madam?
What brings you here?

1885
01:45:35,042 --> 01:45:36,667
I have a business proposal!

1886
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:39,708
Oh. I have a business proposal too...

1887
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:44,208
to mix business with pleasure...

1888
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:46,334
Is this how you conduct
business with everyone?

1889
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:50,292
Sorry.

1890
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:58,250
Mr. Mhatre...

1891
01:45:58,625 --> 01:46:00,708
I'd like you to grant the contract
for Deccan Air's in- flight catering

1892
01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:01,959
to Rani Caterers.

1893
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:05,792
But how would it be possible
to operate from one city?

1894
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,625
We won't be operating from one city.

1895
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:10,125
Rani Bakery is expanding its business.

1896
01:46:10,125 --> 01:46:13,084
Rani Bakery will have branches
in Mumbai, Vijayawada and Pune

1897
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:15,750
which will be run by me,
Che's mother and my brother.

1898
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:19,542
Projected monthly turnover, 1 million.
Which comes to 12 million a year.

1899
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:21,453
Your cut - forty percent.

1900
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:24,083
Sorry, your cut will be
forty percent, sir.

1901
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:30,083
But Ms. Rani, you'll be treated
like any other vendor.

1902
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,875
No special deals for you.

1903
01:46:33,577 --> 01:46:35,577
You won't get any
special discounts either.

1904
01:46:36,167 --> 01:46:37,208
Fair enough.

1905
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:38,750
Confirmed deal?

1906
01:46:41,417 --> 01:46:43,833
Welcome to Deccan Air,
Rani Bakery!

1907
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:46,792
Business is over?

1908
01:46:47,792 --> 01:46:49,792
Can we look into that proposal now?

[upbeat music playing]

1910
01:46:54,833 --> 01:46:55,875
Hey Vir!

1911
01:46:55,875 --> 01:46:58,042
Our plane's landing for
the first time today, right?

1912
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:02,333
According to Vaastu Shastra, it should
be facing the west. Please tell Che!

1913
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:05,000
Hey Uncle, there's no runway
towards the west.

1914
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:06,375
Want him to land the plane
into a ditch?

1915
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,667
I got this coconut from Begumpet market
with such difficulty...

1916
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:11,833
I'll smash it on the wing
of the plane like...

1917
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:12,917
Calm down!

1918
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:15,042
We have to do it, it's tradition.

1919
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:16,208
Hey Mhatre!

1920
01:47:16,625 --> 01:47:17,708
Is that ours?

1921
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:19,333
- Yes it is.
- Uncle!

1922
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,833
Our plane! There.

1923
01:47:27,292 --> 01:47:28,500
Why is he circling?

1924
01:47:28,917 --> 01:47:30,958
Begumpet tower, is there an issue?

1925
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:32,792
- What is happening?
- What happened?

1926
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:33,958
- Sam!
- Yes?

1928
01:47:35,167 --> 01:47:38,375
- Hey, stop, stop!
- Something's happened, let me go see!

1929
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,917
You're pregnant!

This is a fuel emergency, goddammit!

<i>I repeat, turn back Deccan Air 582!</i>

1932
01:47:46,292 --> 01:47:47,708
Why aren't they allowing us
to land, Captain?

1933
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:48,833
There's something wrong.

1934

1936
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:55,250
I'm out of fuel...
Why won't you let me land?

1937
01:47:55,583 --> 01:47:57,833
Mr. Paresh, this is too risky!

1938
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:59,625
You said we were only
going to scare them off!

1939
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:01,208
You are using Civil Aviation property!

1940
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:04,083
If the plane crashes,
I'll be under enquiry!

1941
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,583
- How dare you-
- Deshmukh...

1942
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:07,833
Who got you this position
in the DGCA?

1943
01:48:08,792 --> 01:48:11,542
Brother, we're already
under a CBI enquiry.

1944
01:48:11,792 --> 01:48:14,292

We should stop.

you declare Mayday

1983
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:26,583
to get landing permission
on Begumpet Civil Airport?

1984
01:50:26,708 --> 01:50:28,375
If we had declared Mayday,

1985
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,708
they would seize all our planes
for six months.

1986

Our airline launch is on the 25th August...

1987

Three years ago,

on this very airstrip.

- Chaitanya!
- Sir.

1994
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:57,042
Do you know what we did then?

1995
01:50:57,167 --> 01:50:59,125
We investigated for terrorist links, sir.

1996
01:50:59,583 --> 01:51:02,458
And imposed a fine too...

1997
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:04,125
50 million.

1998
01:51:05,167 --> 01:51:07,333
There have been multiple
security breaches today.

1999
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:12,542
Along with the fine,
you could face ten years in jail.

before you've even taken off.

These three monkeys...

2005
01:51:29,708 --> 01:51:30,958
aren't terrorists.

2006
01:51:33,125 --> 01:51:36,292
But for landing at an Air Force Base
without permission...

2007
01:51:37,292 --> 01:51:38,667
They must pay a fine.

2008
01:51:40,167 --> 01:51:41,792
25,000 rupees.

2009
01:51:44,083 --> 01:51:46,292

the airline launch.

2010
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,417
- Dismissed!
- Sir!

2011
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:51,542
Let's go, Vir!

2012
01:51:51,667 --> 01:51:53,083
Vir...

2013
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:57,625
But you never liked me, sir.

2014
01:51:58,333 --> 01:51:59,500
I still don't!

2015
01:52:01,042 --> 01:52:05,083
But what you're doing today
is much bigger than our egos.

2016
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:09,792
Son, If I didn't punish
you during training,

2017
01:52:09,917 --> 01:52:11,917
I would've lost the respect
of my cadets.

2018
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:14,375
And if I punish you today,

2019
01:52:14,708 --> 01:52:16,375
I would lose respect for myself.

2020
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,458
A soldier never abandons
a fellow soldier in trouble.

2021
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:23,458
You lived up to that ideal today,
Vir Jagannath Mhatre!

2022
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:26,375
- You are a true leader.
- Thank you.

And at your age,
neither should you.

2026
01:52:34,042 --> 01:52:36,375
Don't you dare
talk about my age, man.

2027
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:37,958
Get out!

2028
01:52:49,125 --> 01:52:52,167
Mr. Mhatre, I'm really
sorry to have heard that

2029
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:54,625
your plane crashed yesterday!

Sorry...

2031
01:52:55,667 --> 01:52:59,291
This aviation business isn't
everybody's cup of tea.

2032
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,833
Look at Ratan! He still hasn't- -

2033
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:06,417
Oh Lord! Why does every moron
keep telling me about Tata!

2034
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:10,458
I'm no millionaire.
I have nothing to lose.

2035
01:53:10,708 --> 01:53:12,125
The public is behind me.

2036
01:53:12,917 --> 01:53:14,000
Public!

2037
01:53:14,417 --> 01:53:18,417
Today they're behind you,
tomorrow they'll be running after you.

2038
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:20,208
That's exactly what I want, sir.

2039
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:23,667
When the public runs after me,
who will buy your expensive tickets?

2040
01:53:24,417 --> 01:53:27,167
Now excuse me,
I have an airline to run, my friend!

2041
01:53:27,417 --> 01:53:28,625
See you.

2042
01:53:39,333 --> 01:53:41,000
No matter what we do...

2043
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:44,333
This guy isn't going to stop.

2044
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,125
Jayesh.

2045
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:51,208
Hey, Jayesh!

2046
01:53:51,792 --> 01:53:52,958
Jaiwant, sir.

2047
01:53:53,292 --> 01:53:54,458
Yeah, that.

2048
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:56,583
Have you heard of Vir Mhatre?

2049
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:59,583
The man who's going to
sell cheap air tickets, right?

2050
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,833
Yes. Will you buy a ticket?

2051
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:03,958
How can I afford a plane ticket, sir?

2052
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:07,042
After all, how cheap can it be?

2053
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:08,375
One rupee, sir!

01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:09,708

2055
01:54:09,708 --> 01:54:13,875
10-15 seats go empty
in most flights.

2056
01:54:14,208 --> 01:54:17,625
The advance booking price
for these seats will be one rupee.

2057
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:21,458
Reserving ten seats and claiming
a ticket price of one rupee...

2058
01:54:22,417 --> 01:54:23,667
Aren't you fooling the people?

2059
01:54:23,792 --> 01:54:26,125
Deccan Air has three planes currently.

2060
01:54:26,333 --> 01:54:28,958
Three planes, minimum six trips each.

2061
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:32,542
200 people can travel daily
on a one rupee ticket, sir.

2062
01:54:32,792 --> 01:54:35,333
After the first ten seats
are booked for one rupee,

there will be some seats for 1500,

01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:39,542
then some for 2500, and so on.

2065
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:43,250
As the date of travel approaches,
the ticket prices will increase.

2066
01:54:43,458 --> 01:54:46,792
Still, even the most expensive
tickets on our flights

2067
01:54:46,958 --> 01:54:48,958
will be half the price of
other airlines' tickets.

2068
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:50,917
On some short distance routes,

2069
01:54:51,042 --> 01:54:53,292
our tickets will be
as cheap as train tickets.

2070
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:56,542
If it's really as cheap
as a train ticket...

2071
01:54:57,792 --> 01:54:59,792
Then I'll definitely take
my mother on a flight!

2072
01:55:00,375 --> 01:55:02,208
She's a sanitation worker, sir.

2073
01:55:02,417 --> 01:55:03,958
She's never even seen a plane!

2074
01:55:04,417 --> 01:55:06,125
Sir, if you inaugurate our flight,

2075
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:10,458
your voters will see your commitment
to the common man's progress.

2076
01:55:11,083 --> 01:55:14,208
The common man who can
now dream of flying

2077
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,083
with just one rupee in his pocket.

2078
01:55:18,792 --> 01:55:22,042
Those who clean public toilets
will now be seated next to us.

2079
01:55:22,917 --> 01:55:24,875
He's flying high on people's trust.

2080
01:55:26,708 --> 01:55:28,125
We have to break that trust.

2082

<i>Ever since I joined politics,
it was my dream</i>

2084
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:39,083
to see common people fly
on aeroplanes.

2085
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:43,583
It's with great pride today,
that I announce the launch of Deccan Air!

Master would have been
so proud today!

2088
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, good morning.

2089
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,583
You're welcome onboard
Deccan Air's maiden flight.

2090

How can you do that?

2108

2109

Sir it's a small little glitch,
I'll fix it in half an hour! Please!

01:59:10,167 --> 01:59:13,625
Small glitch?
Mr. Mhatre, I nearly lost my life!

2128
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:15,583
Deccan Air is a total failure!

We want answers!

2134
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,375
Mr. Vir Mhatre, how did the
aircraft engine catch fire?

2135
01:59:38,375 --> 01:59:40,917
There was no fire,
just excess oil spillage.

2136
01:59:41,042 --> 01:59:42,458
There was no danger
to the passengers.

2137
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:44,792
You put Minister Parekh's life
in danger...

2138
01:59:44,917 --> 01:59:46,667
Do you have any links
to the opposition party?

2139
01:59:46,792 --> 01:59:48,500
What nonsense!
Stop making such wild claims!

2140
01:59:48,625 --> 01:59:50,625
It was his first brush with death
on your flight, sir!

2141
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:52,250
How could you let this happen?

2142
01:59:53,417 --> 01:59:54,823

2148
02:00:16,333 --> 02:00:17,875
Don't come.

2149
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,375
I will handle it.

2150
02:00:22,292 --> 02:00:23,500
Let's go.

2151
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:25,917

2152
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,208

02:00:28,708 --> 02:00:30,208
[Reporters] How could you do that, sir?

2154
02:00:30,333 --> 02:00:32,375
How can you leave
without answering us?

2155
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:36,375
Look, we did proper safety checks.

2156
02:00:36,545 --> 02:00:38,920
We got our air-worthiness certificate
through the proper channels.

2157
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:42,625
Low-cost aviation doesn't mean that
we'll compromise passenger safety.

2158
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:44,375
We've followed every single rule...

2159
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:45,958
Our country is already struggling
with so many problems...

2160
02:00:46,083 --> 02:00:47,000
Do we really need this luxury?

2161
02:00:47,125 --> 02:00:50,375
It's this luxury barrier in aviation
that has to be broken!

2162
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:52,792
Just like food, water, electricity
and medical facilities,

2163
02:00:52,958 --> 02:00:56,083
low-cost aviation is crucial
to our progress as a nation!

2164
02:00:56,208 --> 02:00:58,917
This is my field,
this is where I can make a difference!

Oil spillage!
Such a basic mistake?

2176
02:02:30,292 --> 02:02:32,583
- You did the last fuel check, Vir!
- What?

2177
02:02:33,375 --> 02:02:35,375
Captain Manohar told me
that you're doing it...

2178
02:02:35,917 --> 02:02:38,083
But he told me you're doing it!

2179
02:03:04,708 --> 02:03:06,292
I needed the money.

2180
02:03:07,208 --> 02:03:08,500
I'm under a lot of debt.

2181
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,292
More than me?

2182
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,375
Money, power...
They have it all.

2183
02:03:15,708 --> 02:03:17,833
The only weapon we have...

2184
02:03:19,522 --> 02:03:21,022
is the strength to say no.

2185
02:03:23,458 --> 02:03:24,916
I trusted you, Captain.

2186
02:03:26,208 --> 02:03:28,291
That's it?
Won't we throw him out?

2187
02:03:29,042 --> 02:03:30,376
Vir, we should fire him!

2188
02:03:32,731 --> 02:03:34,189
He's my father's age.

2189
02:03:36,458 --> 02:03:37,750
You can go, Captain.

2190
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:46,083
Captain Manohar, was Deccan Air
lax about safety protocols?

2191
02:03:48,042 --> 02:03:49,667
Where did Deccan Air go wrong?

2192
02:03:49,875 --> 02:03:51,584
Was Deccan Air negligent, Captain?

2193
02:03:55,292 --> 02:03:56,334
No, sir.

2194
02:03:57,042 --> 02:03:59,167
But given what happened on
the flight, it seems...

2195
02:03:59,167 --> 02:04:01,416
Sir, it was my fault.

2196
02:04:02,083 --> 02:04:06,041
It was due to my negligence
that excessive fueling happened.

2197
02:04:06,709 --> 02:04:08,750
That's what created all the smoke.

2198
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:10,250
Captain Manohar,

2199
02:04:10,584 --> 02:04:13,042
what you're saying
could land you in jail.

2200
02:04:13,334 --> 02:04:16,792
Please give your statement
without any fear or pressure...

2201
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:20,292
Sir, this is my statement.

2202
02:04:20,584 --> 02:04:23,042
Deccan Air is not responsible.

2203
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:28,042
And it's evident who in this room
is scared, and of whom.

2204
02:04:29,125 --> 02:04:30,625
What are you hinting at?

2205
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:32,250
- Talk clearly...
- Okay, fine!

is in our favour!

2234
02:05:42,917 --> 02:05:44,000
Hello?

2235
02:05:46,584 --> 02:05:47,584
Sir!

2236
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:51,292
We'll be there, sir.

2237
02:05:52,833 --> 02:05:53,958
Who? What?

2238
02:05:54,209 --> 02:05:58,250
<i>The founder of India's biggest airline,
Jaz Airways - Mr. Paresh Goswami</i>

2239
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:01,709
<i>joins us for a special interview,
tomorrow night at 9 pm!</i>

2240
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,250
Why don't you ever
charge your phone?

2241
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Listen.

2242
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:07,750
I got a call from Walia's office.

2243
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:10,292
He wants to buy Deccan Air.

2244
02:06:10,834 --> 02:06:13,292
He's offering 150 million.

2245
02:06:13,792 --> 02:06:15,209
You refused, right?

2246
02:06:16,925 --> 02:06:19,758
Vir, let's at least meet him once.

2247
02:06:20,292 --> 02:06:21,459
I'm not interested.

2248
02:06:24,167 --> 02:06:25,167
Vir...

2249
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:29,000
The train is in the evening.
I'll take your leave.

2250
02:06:29,167 --> 02:06:31,250
Why? At least stay the night?

2251
02:06:32,334 --> 02:06:35,750
No, I just came to see the baby...

2252
02:06:40,917 --> 02:06:42,084
Vir...

2253
02:06:43,834 --> 02:06:49,209
Sayali's to-be in-laws were
asking about the wedding date...

2254
02:06:52,292 --> 02:06:54,000
No pressure!

2255
02:06:55,917 --> 02:06:59,042
Just think and let me know...

2256
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,542
I'll take care of the rest.

2257
02:07:05,584 --> 02:07:06,709
Alright then.

2258
02:07:10,498 --> 02:07:12,558
[baby fussing]

2259
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,542
Vir...

2260
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,584
Are you sure you
want to say no to Walia?

2261
02:07:25,792 --> 02:07:27,875
I mean, let's discuss it once?

2262
02:07:28,459 --> 02:07:29,625
Didn't I tell you?

2263
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:33,042
I don't want to do
any business with them.

2264
02:07:34,584 --> 02:07:35,917
You guys sit, I'll serve the food.

2265
02:07:36,042 --> 02:07:37,375
Vir just...

2266
02:07:42,417 --> 02:07:44,000
How can you decide alone?

2267
02:07:44,584 --> 02:07:47,500
You call this a partnership?
Does only your opinion count?

2268
02:07:47,875 --> 02:07:48,917
Che.

2269
02:07:49,209 --> 02:07:50,500
We're on the verge of losing everything!

2270
02:07:50,625 --> 02:07:53,209
Ever since I left the Air Force,
my father hasn't spoken to me!

2271
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:57,083
Sam faces taunts daily
from his father-in-law!

2272
02:07:57,292 --> 02:07:58,219
Stop it Che.

2273
02:07:58,219 --> 02:08:00,417
At least think of
your own daughter!

2274
02:08:00,625 --> 02:08:02,417
You want her to grow up
paying your debts?

2275
02:08:02,542 --> 02:08:05,417
- What are you saying?
- Go on! Hit me, bugger!

2276
02:08:05,542 --> 02:08:06,750
How do you sleep at night?

2277
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:09,625
1100 people have invested
their life's savings on your dream!

2278
02:08:09,875 --> 02:08:11,875
- And you can't accept a good offer...
- Che, stop it.

2279
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,042
- Only because of your ego!
- It's not my ego!

2280
02:08:15,625 --> 02:08:16,959
It's my belief!

2281
02:08:17,459 --> 02:08:18,625
We can do it.

2282
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:21,667
Why do you think Walia
is giving us such a big offer?

2283
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:24,417
Because he knows that
if Deccan Air takes off,

2284
02:08:24,625 --> 02:08:25,875
it will change India forever.

2285
02:08:26,084 --> 02:08:27,417
He wants to buy us
so he can make sure

2286
02:08:27,542 --> 02:08:29,584
that the skies remain out of
the common man's reach!

2287
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,709
Che, why did we
quit the Air Force?

2288
02:08:33,292 --> 02:08:34,875
What did we set out to do?

2289
02:08:35,792 --> 02:08:37,417
We are so close...

2290
02:08:38,167 --> 02:08:39,959
If we take their
150 million today,

2291
02:08:40,084 --> 02:08:43,292
900 million Indians
will never be able to fly!

[suspenseful music playing]

2293
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:49,750
Che!

2294
02:09:02,265 --> 02:09:04,358
[baby crying]

2295
02:09:08,477 --> 02:09:10,550

[Vir sniffles]

2297
02:10:06,375 --> 02:10:08,334
I didn't think of our family...

2298
02:10:10,709 --> 02:10:12,584
You didn't mix rat poison
in the food, did you?

2299
02:10:13,584 --> 02:10:14,792
I would have...

2300
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:17,334
If you had accepted the offer.

2301
02:10:18,202 --> 02:10:20,282
[sad music playing]

2302
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Vir!

2303
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:34,959
This is a radio station.

2304
02:10:35,167 --> 02:10:37,750
Goswami is speaking to every
TV news channel out there...

2305
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:42,542
The people I want to reach
will hear me on the radio.

2306
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:45,292
People tune into FM stations
more these days...

2307
02:10:45,417 --> 02:10:47,334
I'll speak to some friends
who work there...

2308
02:10:47,459 --> 02:10:49,417
We'll fix some interviews there too.

2309
02:10:49,542 --> 02:10:51,667
- Thank you.
- Okay. Ready?

2310
02:11:00,584 --> 02:11:04,167
3, 2, 1... Go!

2311
02:11:05,125 --> 02:11:07,042
Vir Mhatre... Why Deccan Air?

2312
02:11:07,375 --> 02:11:11,167
People like us have always
been told that we cannot fly.

2313
02:11:11,709 --> 02:11:14,875
That no matter how hard we try,
we can never touch the skies.

2314
02:11:15,167 --> 02:11:18,292
<i>But we want the sky to be in
the common man's grasp.</i>

2315
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:19,959
That's why, Deccan Air.

2316
02:11:20,167 --> 02:11:22,584
<i>In order to move ahead,
at times we must walk,</i>

2317
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:24,792
<i>at times we must run,
and at times, we must fly.</i>

2318
02:11:24,917 --> 02:11:29,209
<i>Which is why our airline will
bring air connectivity to small cities.</i>

2319
02:11:29,334 --> 02:11:33,292
<i>So that people from smaller
cities and towns can also progress.</i>

2320
02:11:33,667 --> 02:11:38,209
Tell me, should success only be
the monopoly of the rich?

2321
02:11:39,292 --> 02:11:42,084
A century ago, they said
we didn't need electricity...

2322
02:11:42,334 --> 02:11:44,542
Fifty years ago,
we didn't need cars!

2323
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:46,834
And now, they say
we don't need to fly. Why?

2324
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,750
Because our lives are
worth nothing to them.

2325
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:52,167
<i>Our time is worth nothing.</i>

2326
02:11:52,417 --> 02:11:56,542
<i>We crawl on the earth
like insects to survive</i>

2327
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,375
and they fly in the skies
just for pleasure.

2328
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,292
Sir, there's one topic
that's on everyone's minds.

2329
02:12:06,542 --> 02:12:08,000
Low-cost aviation.

2330
02:12:08,125 --> 02:12:09,334
What are your thoughts on this?

2331
02:12:11,083 --> 02:12:16,125
When you're flying at
an altitude of thirty thousand feet,

2332
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:20,167
at a speed of thousand km per hour,

2333
02:12:20,833 --> 02:12:23,750
in a box made of aluminium...

2334
02:12:24,167 --> 02:12:25,500
What's your top priority?

2335
02:12:25,709 --> 02:12:27,375
- Safety.
- Exactly!

2336
02:12:28,292 --> 02:12:30,375
And to ensure this safety,

2337
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:35,334
you require testing and checking
equipment, you need training.

2338
02:12:35,709 --> 02:12:37,709
And all of this costs money.

2339
02:12:38,292 --> 02:12:43,084
If you sell tickets this cheap,
how can you provide all this?

2340
02:12:44,667 --> 02:12:48,250
<i>To be honest, I don't just feel
worried for their passengers,</i>

2341
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,667
<i>I feel scared for them.</i>

2342
02:12:49,917 --> 02:12:53,486
They aren't scared for us,
They are scared of us.

2343
02:12:54,125 --> 02:12:59,334
<i>If the people who drive their cars,
cook their food and clean their homes</i>

2344
02:12:59,334 --> 02:13:00,959
<i>sit side-by-side with them today,</i>

2345
02:13:01,084 --> 02:13:03,084
<i>tomorrow they might even
rise above them!</i>

2346
02:13:03,334 --> 02:13:06,334
They're talking about safety?
Then go ask them this:

2347
02:13:06,584 --> 02:13:10,375
<i>Business class tickets are thrice
as expensive as economy.</i>

2348
02:13:10,584 --> 02:13:14,167
So are Business class passengers
guaranteed thrice the level of safety?

2349
02:13:14,792 --> 02:13:18,292
<i>Cheap tickets doesn't mean that
we compromise on safety.</i>

2350
02:13:18,875 --> 02:13:23,167
<i>Sir, Deccan Air has passed
every standard safety test</i>

2351
02:13:23,292 --> 02:13:25,584
that their airline has passed.

2352
02:13:25,917 --> 02:13:28,084
Brother and sisters,
don't think twice!

2353
02:13:28,292 --> 02:13:31,375
<i>Make one phone call,
and book your Deccan Air ticket!</i>

2354
02:13:31,375 --> 02:13:33,292
<i>Show your PNR number,
and collect your ticket</i>

2355
02:13:33,292 --> 02:13:36,375
<i>from your nearest post office
or petrol pump!</i>

2356
02:13:36,542 --> 02:13:39,292
<i>Come quick, come now!
Take a flight through the clouds!</i>

2357
02:13:39,667 --> 02:13:41,334
If I may be honest with you...

2358
02:13:41,459 --> 02:13:44,959
<i>In these current times,
bringing low-cost aviation to India</i>

2359
02:13:45,167 --> 02:13:46,542
is a huge risk!

2360
02:13:46,834 --> 02:13:48,334
It's akin to mass murder!

2361
02:13:48,625 --> 02:13:50,084
And we've already seen

2362
02:13:50,209 --> 02:13:53,334
how they've lowered the standards
of the aviation industry.

2363
02:13:54,167 --> 02:13:56,125
It's a substandard product.

2364
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:57,584
Retired pilots...

2365
02:13:58,667 --> 02:14:02,125
Our pilots have flown fighter jets
for the Indian Air force.

2366
02:14:02,375 --> 02:14:05,084
You couldn't possibly
be in safer hands!

2367
02:14:06,834 --> 02:14:08,209
<i>What motivates you to do this?</i>

2368
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:09,250
Is it money?

2369
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:12,292
If making money was my goal,
I'd have done anything else.

2370
02:14:12,292 --> 02:14:14,667
Run a business,
bought a plane for myself.

2371
02:14:15,042 --> 02:14:17,250
<i>I could just chill at home
and enjoy life.</i>

2372
02:14:17,459 --> 02:14:19,625
<i>My wife's bakery business
is doing very well.</i>

2373
02:14:21,167 --> 02:14:23,250
And you're asking me
why I'm doing all this?

2374
02:14:24,334 --> 02:14:26,792
I don't just want to break
the cost barrier for people,

2375
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:29,000
I want to break
the goddamn caste barrier too!

2376
02:14:29,375 --> 02:14:32,500
<i>That's the reason our tickets
cost as low as one rupee.</i>

2377
02:14:33,334 --> 02:14:35,000
<i>Not because of poor quality.</i>

2378
02:14:35,292 --> 02:14:38,209
Are your lives worth
only one rupee?

2379
02:14:38,542 --> 02:14:40,667
<i>How is safety possible
at this cost?</i>

2380
02:14:43,084 --> 02:14:45,459
I'll do one final safety test
for everyone to see.

2381
02:14:46,125 --> 02:14:49,542
The three people who
are most precious to me

2382
02:14:50,209 --> 02:14:52,834
will travel on Deccan Air's
first flight...

2383
02:14:54,167 --> 02:14:55,334
My mother,

2384
02:14:56,959 --> 02:14:58,167
my wife Rani,

2385
02:15:00,209 --> 02:15:03,334
and my eight day-old
daughter, Amu.

2386
02:15:05,375 --> 02:15:07,875
To trust such a man
with running an airline

2387
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,584
is like handing a gun
to a madman.

2388
02:15:10,792 --> 02:15:11,958
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

He says it so convincingly that
even I have started believing him!

- Vir!
- Vir!

Che and I have been trying
to call you for so long!

My phone's battery is down
and so is mine.

2394
02:15:27,167 --> 02:15:28,834
You haven't slept for three days.

2395
02:15:29,125 --> 02:15:30,459
Let's go home, buddy.

2396
02:15:30,875 --> 02:15:33,042
What if that rascal tries
to sabotage us again?

2397
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:36,084
We'll have to guard
our aircraft on our own.

on a one rupee ticket!

2573
02:30:00,292 --> 02:30:03,750
Forget the plane,
the cupcake was so good!

2574
02:30:03,917 --> 02:30:06,584
I'll buy another ticket
just to have it again!

2575
02:30:06,917 --> 02:30:08,584
Heard that, honeybun?

2576
02:30:09,792 --> 02:30:11,417
Hey, why are you crying!

2577
02:30:12,375 --> 02:30:14,375
- Whose idea was it?
- It was hers.

2578
02:30:14,625 --> 02:30:17,417
Mr. Parekh! How are you, sir?
How have you been!

2579
02:30:17,542 --> 02:30:19,375
Goswami! What were you thinking?

2580
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,709
That I won't find out

2581
02:30:20,834 --> 02:30:23,459
that you sabotaged
the plane I was in?

2582
02:30:23,792 --> 02:30:25,667
- Me?
- I could've died.

2583
02:30:25,875 --> 02:30:28,042
- No sir, it's a misunderstanding!
- Get out.

2584
02:30:28,167 --> 02:30:29,042
One minute...

2585
02:30:29,167 --> 02:30:30,917
- Sir this is sheer misunderstanding...
- Out!

2586
02:30:31,042 --> 02:30:32,167
Let me explain!

2587
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:03,625
He's not married yet!

2588
02:31:06,250 --> 02:31:07,542
Oh, my!

2589
02:31:08,709 --> 02:31:11,292
Vir, did she fly us here?

2590
02:31:11,667 --> 02:31:13,542
Yes, how does that feel?
